## About run_analysis script
If the data files for this project is not in your working directory, the script will automatically download it to your working directory, then will unzip it.

For creating tidy data, this script uses reshape2 package (which is very useful and I recommend regardless of this course), if it is not installed in your system, the code will make sure that it will install.
